**Running ALM simulation with SOWFA**

1. Launch OpenFoam
of240

2. Navigate to the root directiory of the case you want to run
cd <directiory_path>
Note: This folder should contain three folders:
- 0: Initial condition
- constant: Wind turbine parameters
- system: Solver parameters

3. Create the mesh and write logs to blockMesh.log
blockMesh >> blockMesh.log 2>&1 &

4. Run the solver and write logs to pisoFoam.log
pisoFoamTurbine.ALM >> pisoFoam.log 2>&1 &

Note: the ampsersand character at the end of the commands above will send the excecution to the background. To monitor the status of the job you can use:

- To see the jobs that are excecuting: jobs -l
- To kill a job: kill 9 <job_pid>
- To bring a job to the foreground: fg <job_pid>
- To send the job back to the background without killing it: ctrl+Z
- To kill a job in the foreground: ctrl+c
- To monitor the logs that are being written by the job: tail -f <log_name>
- To monitor the machine resource usage: htop

Simulation length and file dump frequency is controlled through parameters in the file system/controlDict

The Postprocessing folder contains reference values and Python scripts for extracting the data from the flow field through paraview. 

Multiple cases can be run in parallel in the same machine. They're run in serial, then each case would use a complete CPU and about 3GB of RAM with the 1.5M cells mesh.
