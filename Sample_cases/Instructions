**Running ALM simulation with SOWFA**

1. Launch OpenFoam
of240

2. Navigate to the root directiory of the case you want to run
cd <directiory_path>
Note: This folder should contain three folders:
- 0: Initial condition
- constant: Wind turbine parameters
- system: Solver parameters

3. Create the mesh and write logs to blockMesh.log
blockMesh >> blockMesh.log 2>&1 &

4. Run the solver and write logs to pisoFoam.log
pisoFoamTurbine.ALM >> pisoFoam.log 2>&1 &

Note: the ampsersand character at the end of the commands above will send the excecution to the background. To monitor the status of the job you can use:

- To see the jobs that are excecuting: jobs
- To kill a job: kill 9 <job_id>
- To bring a job to the foreground: fg <job_id>
- To send the job back to the background without killing it: ctrl+Z
- To kill a job in the foreground: ctrl+c
- To monitor the logs that are being written by the job: tail -f <log_name>

Simulation length and file dump frequency is controlled through parameters in the file system/controlDict
